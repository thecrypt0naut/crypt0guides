# Vultr VPS

This guide will walk you through setting up your first VPS (Virtual Private Server) on Vultr.com.  If you want you can use [my affiliate link](https://www.vultr.com/?ref=7466438) to sign up and give me a little kickback.

Vultr is a particularly good choice for hosting masternode VPS thanks to its free IPv6 support.  This allows multiple IP addresses per server and means you can run multiple nodes of the same coin on the same VPS if you want.

For coins that support IPv6 nodes this is really efficient as you still pay just the standard VPS cost per month.  For IPv4 only coins you'll end up paying an extra $2/month per extra IP and you can have up to 3 IPs on one VPS.
