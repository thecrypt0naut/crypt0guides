# Masternode Guides

Here you will find my step-by-step masternode setup guides for specific coins.  The aim is to let people with little knowledge of linux set up effective and secure masternodes as easily as possible.

## Some Background

A lot of masternode coins have pretty incomplete or confusing guides.  When I started out I worked through whatever instructions were posted on Discord, but I quickly got frustrated with buggy instructions and being told to use binary wallets rather than building from source.

I started searching for a better solution and stumbled across the [Nodemaster script by Florian Maier](https://github.com/masternodes/vps).  He claims it's the most straightforward way to set up any masternode, and I'd be inclined to agree with him.  It's a consistently slick process that I've never looked back from.

It was never my intention to write guides, but I got into a discussion with a Discord mod and they asked me to make a guide for their community, to show them how to make stress free masternodes even if they don't have any Linux experience.

## VPS Setup

The best way to run a masternode is with a secure Virtual Private Server (VPS).  These allow you to run a "cold node" which means the masternode itself doesn't have direct control of your coins and protects you in case of server intrusion.

I recommend Vultr.com for this service, and I've written [a guide](docs/vultr_vps.md) to setting up and maintaining VPS on their platform.

## Coin Specific Guides
